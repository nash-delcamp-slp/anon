A list of predefined collections of named entity types for use with
spaCy's named entity recognition. These collections group entity types
by semantic categories, making it easier to extract related types of entities.
}

\itemize{
\item \strong{CARDINAL}: Numerals that do not fall under another type
\item \strong{DATE}: Absolute or relative dates or periods
