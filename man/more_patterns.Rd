\description{
Accepts a character vector of patterns and returns an expanded vector containing:
\enumerate{
\item Original items
\item Patterns with spaces replaced with a pattern of any number of spaces and any
one character between words.
\item Individual words from each item, split by spaces and punctuation
}
}

while taking additional efforts to anonymize all sensitive information.
